README: User-Guided Interactive Machine Learning for High-Throughput, Multi-Scale Helium Bubble Segmentation and Quantification
Overview

This project introduces a novel User-Guided Interactive Machine Learning Framework for high-throughput, multi-scale helium bubble segmentation and quantification. Combining advanced image processing techniques with deep learning, the framework leverages Mask R-CNN for semantic segmentation and incorporates GCM for refined analysis. This tool provides a scalable and customizable approach for helium bubble analysis, empowering researchers with precise, user-friendly, and interactive workflows.
